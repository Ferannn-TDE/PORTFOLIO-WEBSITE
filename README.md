React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react
â€“ uses Babel
for Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
â€“ uses SWC
for Fast Refresh.

Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the TS template
for information on how to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint
in your project.
